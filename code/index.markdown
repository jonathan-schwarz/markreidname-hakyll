# Code  ![Mark Reid in the Matrix](/pics/me_matrix.png)

This page will contain links to some of the research and non-research
related programming I've done. My [GitHub profile](https://github.com/mreid/) 
has more of my code-related activities.

# ML as a Service
[The PSI Project](https://github.com/psi-project/)
:    James Montogomery's implementation of the 
	 [PSI specification](http://psi.cecs.anu.edu.au/spec) I co-wrote for presenting
	 machine learning resources (e.g., learning algorithms, predictors, data sets)
	 as RESTful web services.
	 This was work done as part of the 
	 [Protocols and Structures for Inference](http://psi.cecs.anu.edu.au) ARC
	 Linkage project
	 with Canon Information Systems Research Australia (CISRA).

Demos
=====
[Mutli-armed Bandits](/code/bandits/)
:	This JavaScript demo allows you to configure and run a multi-armed bandit game
    and plot the resulting rewards for a variety of agents.

Tools
=====
[Feed Bag](/code/feed-bag.html)
:	This is a simple ruby script that parses and normalises RSS feeds, storing 
	the resulting entries in an SQL database.

Other Hacking
=====================
[Decision Trees in Haskell](https://github.com/mreid/HTrees)
:   A very basic implementation of decision tree learning in 
    Haskell. It makes of monoids for efficient aggreation and evaluation of
	splits.

[Plain Text Wiki](/code/plain-text-wiki.html)
:	I extended Matt Webb's original [Plain Text Wiki][] with a few 
	modifications of my own. I use it to manage the content on this
	site.


[Jekyll][]
:	I have contributed some minor improvements (Maruku markup, categories,
	permalink options) to the static blog engine [Jekyll][] which,
	I used to use to run this site.

[Instiki][]
:	I was one of the contributors to the [Instiki][] codebase. I helped
	streamline and extend the parser that handles the wiki markup.
