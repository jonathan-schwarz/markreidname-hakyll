I gave a seminar to NICTA's [Machine Learning Group](https://www.nicta.com.au/category/research/machine-learning/). I presented summaries of the work I presented at COLT (with Rafael Frongillo, Bob Willimson, and Nishant Mehta) on [generalized mixability](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v40/Reid15.html) and some more recent work with Raf on risk networks.
